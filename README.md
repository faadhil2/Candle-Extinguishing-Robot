# Candle-Extinguishing-Robot
This robot was made to complete a task while deployed in a fictitious world/scenario.

The "World":
The world was a rectangular-shaped city neighbourhood with 4 residential blocks. The surface of this world is flat (ground) and the border of this city was outlined by black tape placed on the floor. Each corner and intersection of this city had a lit candle and one of the residential blocks contained a visible civillian (Please refer to world diagram).

The Mission:
Our mission was to design a robot that would navigate this city, without crossing the city's borders or collide with any of the buildings. Furthermore, while navingating the city, the robot would have to extinguish every candle that was lit, avoid the candles that were unlit, and discover the civillian.
